# I've moved to Bluesky

Hello All! While I was never super active on the bird site, given recent developments I've decided to migrate what little activity I have to Bluesky. So far the community that is developing there seems to be very positive and supportive. 

If you are on Bluesky, feel free to give me a follow and more than likely I'll follow you back. 

## What's changed?

Effectively nothing significant. I've updated the social media buttons on this site to point to Bluesky instead of X/Twitter, and will be posting to Bluesky in lieu of Twitter going forward.
