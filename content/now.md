# What is this?
As inspired by Derek Sivers at https://sive.rs/now, this page is what is going on in my life right now. Updated September 17, 2024.

## Life

We went up to the boundary waters canoe area (BWCA) for the third year in a row this year over the Labor Day holiday weekend, and took Bailey with for the second year in a row. Gwen and I had a blast with that trip, although this time it was much more windy than we were expecting (we nearly swamped a canoe in whitecaps one day).


## Work

I just celebrated 9 years at InVita (formerly Transplant Connect). The work remains challenging as my role continues to evolve as the business grows. The big push lately has been getting all of the Transplant infrastructure into IaC (using Terraform) and concurrently beefing up the security posture. With all of that going on (plus providing a bit of help on a few other things) things are staying very busy.
