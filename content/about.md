Hi, I'm Luke, a software developer with over a decade of experience. My passion lies in solving complex problems in .NET environments, whether on Windows or Linux-based servers. Lately, my focus has shifted toward DevOps, where I work on building efficient, scalable systems that make life easier for both developers and operations teams.

When I’m not deep in code, you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors. I love hiking, backpacking, and pretty much anything that gets me out into nature. Living in Minnesota, I’ve learned to appreciate both the beauty and the challenges of every season. 

If you want to stay in touch, leave a comment or reach me on [Twitter][twitter] or [Threads][threads]. You should check my projects at [Github][github], and don't forget to subscribe to this blog's [RSS feed][feed].
