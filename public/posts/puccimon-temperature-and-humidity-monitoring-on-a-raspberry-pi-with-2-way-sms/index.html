        <p>Over the last weekend I decided it would be fun to brush off one of my old Raspberry Pis and play with some of the hardware that I bought for it a while back for a project I was going to do and subsequently abandoned. Overall what I wanted to accomplish was pretty simple: have a little C-based application which can read the AM2302 sensor which was attached to the Pi and use the Twilio REST interface via C in order to send messages.</p>
<p>I ended up going a little beyond my original goals since I discovered how easy Twilio makes it to respond to inbound SMS. I had a partially developed Flask application (<a href="https://www.puccithe.dog"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) which I could easily extend to have an additional method which Twilio could invoke.</p>
<p>Before going any further, the Python/Flask code is <a href="https://github.com/lbearl/puccithe.dog"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and the C code for the Pi is <a href="https://github.com/lbearl/PucciMon"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. I haven&rsquo;t written a single line of C code in about 4 years, so I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s stylistically not the greatest code out there, but it is functional for my purposes.</p>

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The first step in this project is to wire up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018JO5BRK"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AM2302 sensor</a> to the Raspberry Pi. Note for this project I&rsquo;m using the Model B Pi 1 (I purchased it way back in 2013, and it&rsquo;s been repurposed a few times now). The AM2302 can be directly connected to the GPIO pins on the Pi. For wiring the positive lead (the black wire on the sensor I have), should go to pin 1. The negative lead (the grey wire) goes to pin 6. The white one goes to pin 7 (GPIO4 on the Pi).</p>
<p>The AM2302 should look similar to this: <img src="images/am2302.jpg" alt="AM2302 picture"></p>
<p>After wiring up the RPi, it should look like this (ignore the case I have on mine): <img src="images/rpi-wiring.jpg" alt="Wired Raspberry Pi"></p>
<p>Now that everything is wired up, the hardware portion of this project should be done.</p>

  </a>
</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, you&rsquo;ll need a Twilio account in order to proceed. The next step will require us to know the From number, Twilio Account SID and Auth Token. If you head over to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio</a>, the onboarding experience is pretty painless.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already booted up your Pi, do so now and make sure you have a good network connection. I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;ve prepared the Pi with the default Raspbian Debian-derived Linux installation that most people use.</p>
<p>In order to make full use of everything, you&rsquo;ll need to get two sets of code: the C based application which handles querying the AM2302 and a second Python/Flask based application which handles the Twilio webhooks.</p>
<ol>
<li>SSH to your Pi</li>
<li><code>cd</code> to wherever you want the code to live</li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/lbearl/PucciMon.git</code> to get the C code</li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/lbearl/puccithe.dog.git</code> to get the python code</li>
<li>Set the following environment variables: a. <code>export TWIL_WEATHER_NUMBER=&lt;Your From Number in E.164 format&gt;</code> b. <code>export TWIL_WEATHER_AUTH=&lt;Your Twilio Auth key&gt;</code> c. <code>export TWIL_WEATHER_SID=&lt;Your Twilio SID&gt;</code> d. <code>export TWIL_WEATHER_TONUMS=&lt;Comma separated list of recipients in E.164 format&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>cd</code> into PucciMon and run <code>make</code> (of course you have to have all of the build tools installed)</li>
<li><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/lbearl/</code> in order to make directory for the file.</li>
<li>Execute <code>sudo -E ./bin/c_sms -f</code> and make sure that the AM2302 was read and that you receive an SMS. a. <img src="images/test-run.png" alt="Test run output of application"></li>
<li>Execute <code>cat /opt/lbearl/temp.txt</code> and verify that it matches the output of the test run.</li>
<li>In order to make things slightly easier to execute, without always requiring sudo, I&rsquo;ve found that setting UID works well:</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/lbearl/bin
sudo cp ./bin/c_sms /opt/lbearl/bin/c_sms
chown root /opt/lbearl/bin/c_sms
chmod u+s /opt/lbearl/bin/c_sms
</code></pre><p>At this point the sensor is working properly and can be read, the remainder of the setup is getting the flask application up and running. I&rsquo;ve opted to do this using WSGI on Apache. The relevant configuration is as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;

        ServerAlias www.puccithe.dog

                WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
                Order deny,allow
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        # I use CloudFlare&#39;s certificates so that I don&#39;t have to muck about with anything else
        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/puccithedog-cf.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/puccithedog-cf.key
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre><p>The WSGI file is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import sys
activate_this = &#39;/home/pi/puccidog/puccidog/env/Scripts/activate_this.py&#39;
execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))
sys.path.insert(0, &#39;/home/pi/puccidog/puccidog&#39;)

import logging, sys
logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr)

from puccidog import app as application
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of years since I set that up (the Flask application was actually originally used for a different side project, and I just repurposed it to process the webhooks). If you look around on the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/mod_wsgi/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flask website</a>, they have some good documentation around how to make this work.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;m using CloudFlare to handle all of the DNS and SSL around this. CloudFlare has a little known feature where they actually are able to use recent versions of <code>ddclient</code> in order to update your <code>A</code> records. I used to use Namecheap&rsquo;s Dynamic DNS, and the CloudFlare one is just as simple to set up. The one big gotcha is that the version of ddclient that ships with Raspbian by default isn&rsquo;t new enough to support CloudFlare. In order to fix it, we have to install a brand new version. Jens Segers wrote up a great summary on <a href="https://jenssegers.com/84/dynamic-dns-for-cloudflare-with-ddclient"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to do it</a>. The short version is that we need to download <code>ddclient</code> from SourceForge and then overwrite our local copy. The configuration file layout changed, so we need to create an <code>/etc/ddclient</code> directory and move (or create a new) <code>/etc/ddclient/ddclient.conf</code> in there. The configuration should look something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>################
# ddclient.conf
################
use=web, web=dyndns
ssl=yes
protocol=cloudflare,
server=www.cloudflare.com,
zone=puccithe.dog,
login=&lt;CloudFlare Email Address&gt;
password=&lt;CloudFlare API Key&gt;
puccithe.dog,
</code></pre><h2 id="testing">

  <a class="heading-link" href="#testing">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Now if you send an SMS to your Twilio &ldquo;From&rdquo; number, you should get a response back a few seconds later which has the most recent temperature data. Additionally, if you scheduled everything in <code>cron</code>, then any time a measurement comes in above 86F/30C, you&rsquo;ll get an SMS. You can also pass <code>-f</code> to the <code>c_sms</code> binary any time in order to force it to send SMS messages.</p>

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Why did I build this? Mostly because it was fun, and also partly because sometimes I forget to turn on the AC and don&rsquo;t want my dog to have to suffer. I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed building it.</p>
