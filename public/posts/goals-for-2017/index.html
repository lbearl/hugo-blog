I work as a senior full-stack engineer at my full-time job, and also work as (the only) infrastructure engineer for my wife&rsquo;s businesses (1, 2) both of which keep me fairly busy, but as a professional I&rsquo;m always curious what other people are working on, and what other stacks are out there. In order to start getting more exposure to other ways people are doing things I&rsquo;m going to start trying to attend at least one meetup a month just to chat with other developers and engineers. A stretch goal to this would be to find one or more conference (ideally within the Greater Los Angeles area) to attend.">

<p>This one is kind of easy resolution as I&rsquo;ve already started working on another side project. Historically my issue with side projects is that I&rsquo;m great at working on something for one or two days, but staying focused on it long-term has been an issue. The goal with this resolution isn&rsquo;t so much to just start a bunch of projects, it&rsquo;s to work on actually shipping things. I did ship a couple of (very small) side projects last year (both are .NET centric):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lbearl/BlockListChecker"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockListChecker</a> - A tool to check if an email address is on any of many ESPs suppression lists.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lbearl/NuGetVersionChecker"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NuGetVersionChecker</a> - A tool to generate a (very simplistic) report of packages in a package.config file.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to ship at least 6 projects this year (assuming some mix of very simple to somewhat complex).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a bit of a bookworm, although I&rsquo;ve gravitated towards fiction. I recently got a Kindle Paper-white and have found it to be very easy to read on (even for technical books). I&rsquo;ve already started reading &ldquo;The Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo;, and while the book itself is a bit dated, I&rsquo;m finding there to be a lot of great content. At the tail end of last year I also signed up as a volunteer reviewer for <a href="https://www.manning.com/manuscript-reviews"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manning Publication Review</a>, and have already reviewed one book (which was a fantastic read, I&rsquo;m excited for the remainder of the book to be released so I can finish it). I&rsquo;ve been adding programming books to an Amazon wish list for a few years now, and 2017 will the year I&rsquo;ll try to get through at least a few of them. To steal an idea from &ldquo;The Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going to try to get through at least one book per quarter (ideally even quicker than that though).</p>
<h2 id="more-writing">
  More Writing

<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume that as of the writing of this post I have exactly zero regular readers on this blog. There are probably two major reasons for that: a) I don&rsquo;t write on a regular basis; and b) I need to become a better writer. The nice thing is that the resolution to both of those issues is the same: write more. Writing is a skill like any other, where the more it is done, the better it will become (getting feedback is helpful in that as well).</p>

<p>I think every person has this resolution every year. I spend 60+ hours a week in front a computer between my job, my wife&rsquo;s businesses, and working on side projects/playing games/etc. I do a few things which help: I ride my bicycle to work most days, and try to either go for a long hike or a long bike ride every weekend. There are a few low hanging fruit and a few habit-changes I can make which will make me healthier and also prevent RSI in my hands/wrists (something I periodically struggle with).</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop slouching - proper posture would go light-years to keeping me in good shape.</li>
<li>Drink more water - as my coworkers can attest I drink way to much coffee (3-5 cups most days), and in the afternoon I like carbonated and heavily caffeinated drinks. To start I am going to start trying to drink one glass of water for every cup of coffee I have in the mornings. For my afternoon drinks I&rsquo;m going to stop with the energy drinks and start sticking to sugar-free soda (which obviously has less sugar, and also much less caffeine).</li>
<li>Eat healthier - While I get a fair amount of cardio in every day (bike rides and afternoon walks), most things I&rsquo;ve read lately show that weight control is really a function of your diet (i.e. working out is great for your heart, but if you want to lose or maintain your current weight, calorie restriction is the only real sure-fire way to do it).</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried publicly blogging my resolution before, let&rsquo;s see if it makes me a bit more accountable. If nothing else, I&rsquo;ll be able to point my browser to this page anytime I need a bit of motivation to keep on track with my goals for the year. These are all fairly conservative goals, so I&rsquo;m optimistic of being to both meet and exceed them, which should put me in a great spot for 2018.</p>
