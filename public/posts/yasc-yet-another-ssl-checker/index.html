<p>This application was kind of fun in that the core logic which actually &ldquo;does&rdquo; the important part of checking the SSL certificates is only a couple-dozen lines of code. The way it works is to open up a connection to a server and then take a look at the SSL certificate that was associated with the response. There are a few &ldquo;limitations&rdquo; around what can be inspected currently, as anything other than a non-expired, trusted certificate will throw an exception. I figured it would be fun to play around with Hangfire and Sendgrid as well in order to do a nice background batch email process.</p>

<p>If you want to play around with it, the application is running on a free Azure App Service <a href="http://yetanothersslchecker.azurewebsites.net/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Note that these free services will turn themselves off with inactivity, so almost certainly (unless this service becomes incredibly popular), the cron tasks that Hangfire is executing will not happen (as that would require the server to be running).</p>

<p>This was a really fun 1 day project which let me play around with a few technologies I have played with in a very limited fashion. There are a number of bugs I noticed, so this could really use a bit of polish and TLC, but that probably won&rsquo;t happen anytime soon. Please poke around at the code, let me know if you see anything really &ldquo;surprising&rdquo; or anything which would be an easy improvement.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
