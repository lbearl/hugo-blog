      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us who are on Google&amp;rsquo;s Legacy Free G Suite plan, there was an announcement the other day that all good things must come to an end. Sometime in the July timeframe everyone will need to either start paying or stop using the service. Fortuitously, Apple recently (in October) announced custom domain support for iCloud. For people who were using G Suite only as an email service (i.e. no Google Docs, or other Google Apps), and are only using it for personal accounts, iCloud can serve as a perfectly acceptable email host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
