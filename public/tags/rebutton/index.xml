      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife was watching Shark Tank a few weeks ago and we were both chatting about a thing we saw (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/lovesync-shark-tank-sex-button-kickstarter-mark-cuban-barabara-corcoran-2020-1&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;which wasn&amp;rsquo;t funded&lt;/a&gt;). It was kind of a clever idea, and I&amp;rsquo;ll sidestep the entire discussion of whether or not it is a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; product or not, I just wanted to see what it would take to build something kind of like it (this is loosely inspired by LoveSync, but the LoveSync does have some interesting features around time and also their hardware is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; prettier than what I&amp;rsquo;m using).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
