      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://lukebearl.com/2016/09/gentle-introduction-1/&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this series we discussed what an onion architecture application would look like and discussed the technologies that we can leverage in .Net 4 in order to make that work. In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll go over how the project is structured, including spending a bit of time looking at how the IoC container is configured. This being a simple application the configuration is significantly easier to understand than it can be in more complex applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to part one of a multi part series on Enterprise Application in .Net Core! In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll go over everything that is necessary to build a best in breed enterprise application with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Onion Architecture&lt;/a&gt; at its core. The word enterprise is integral in describing the software being described as it is going to be software which is capable of being extended year after year in a clean fashion while allowing things to stay &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt; and testable. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the following:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I along with three of my colleagues were selected to lead the entire architecture and build out all of the core features. All four of us are somewhat experienced developers, but none of us has ever worked on an architecture team at the very beginning of a software project which is very much enterprise-class software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
