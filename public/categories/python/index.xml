      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last weekend I decided it would be fun to brush off one of my old Raspberry Pis and play with some of the hardware that I bought for it a while back for a project I was going to do and subsequently abandoned. Overall what I wanted to accomplish was pretty simple: have a little C-based application which can read the AM2302 sensor which was attached to the Pi and use the Twilio REST interface via C in order to send messages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
